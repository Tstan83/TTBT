            <b className="text-yellow-200">How much is a small tattoo?</b><br/> The shop minimum is $150. This minimum covers my time and supplies<br/><br/>

<b className="text-yellow-200">What’s your rate?</b><br/> The shop hourly rate is $200/hour.<br/><br/>

<b className="text-yellow-200">How old do I have to be to get tattooed?</b><br/> 18 with valid ID. No exceptions. <br/><br/>

<b className="text-yellow-200">Do you do genital, facial, eyeball tattoos?</b><br/> Head/face,neck and hand/palm/finger tattoos can be provided if we have a strong rapport and I know you. I do not do these tattoos on just whoever. I DO NOT do any gential tattoos or eyeball tattoos on anyone, for any reason. <br/><br/>

<b className="text-yellow-200">Do you do cover-ups? </b><br/> I can do them. I will only take on cover-ups if I feel like I can do it in a way that doesn’t look like an obvious cover up. <br/><br/>

<b className="text-yellow-200">What forms of payment do you accept? </b><br/> At this moment cash and Venmo are the only forms of payment I accept. We have an ATM in the lobby for your convenience.<br/><br/>

<b className="text-yellow-200">Do you use numbing cream?</b><br/> No. I do not use any numbing cream for any reason as it can affect the healing and overall saturation of the tattoo. It is an insurance headache as well. <br/><br/>

<b className="text-yellow-200">Can I bring a friend/partner/relative to watch? </b><br/> No. Please do not bring guests with you. If they need to be present they can wait in the lobby, if there is room for them. <br/><br/>

<b className="text-yellow-200">Can you do a drawing by me/friend/kid/someone who doesn’t tattoo? </b><br/> If it’s your kids drawing, that can probably be arranged. If you want someone who doesn’t tattoo and is not a professional artist to draw your tattoo,I’m not into that. I can draw your idea and prefer that over correcting someone else’s drawings like an art teacher. </p>
