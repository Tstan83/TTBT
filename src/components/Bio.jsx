            Hailing from the shadows of Mount Rainier, 
            Travis&apos;s main goal is to create visually impactful tattoos, with a traditional foundation, that stand the test of time. 
            Horror movies, specifically Giallo films, Electronic Body Music, low brow outsider art and retrofuturism heavily influence and inform his eclectic style and 
            approach to traditional tattooing.
